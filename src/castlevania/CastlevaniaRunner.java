/**
 * Alright, let's talk about this project. I've probably spent around
 * 50 hours on this thing alone, and it's been one heck of a job.
 * There's still the bugs, when the player attacks an enemy, sometimes
 * multiple "particle" clouds come out, and when he faces left and attacks,
 * the sprite is screwed up. It's a small game, only four levels and 
 * it randomly generates enemies, collision detection is kind of 
 * whacked up, but all in all, I don't think it's an awful game,
 * and I definitely put in a lot of work into it. It was very hard.
